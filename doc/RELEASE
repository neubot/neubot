#. Build a release using the following commands::

     make release
     sudo ./MacOS/makepkg.py
     Win32/setup.py

   The first command runs on any UNIX operating system and creates
   a Debian and source release.  The second runs on MacOSX and
   creates a MacOS release.  The third runs on Windows only and
   creates a Windows release.
