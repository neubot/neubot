.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fI\%Neubot\fP is a free\-software Internet bot that gathers network performance
data useful to investigate network neutrality. Neubot runs in the
background and periodically performs active network tests with test
servers provided by \fI\%Measurement Lab\fP (a distributed server platform
that hosts open network measurement tools). Implemented tests are
described in the \fI\%IMPLEMENTED TESTS\fP section.
.sp
Neubot does not perform any network test until you grant it the
permission to collect and publish your IP address for research
purposes. Neubot behaves like this because it is developed in the
European Union; therefore, it must comply with European privacy laws
(which consider IP addresses personal data). See the \fI\%PRIVACY\fP
section for more info.
.sp
Neubot is a background process. You can control it by using its
subcommands, its web interface or its web API. Neubot
listens for web requests at \fBhttp://127.0.0.1:9774/\fP. To access
the web interface, use either your favorite browser or the \fBviewer\fP
subcommand. To change the address and/or port where Neubot listens
for web requests, edit \fB/etc/neubot/api\fP (see the \fI\%FILES\fP
section).
.sp
Neubot runs with the privileges of the \fB_neubot\fP user,
or with the ones of the user indicated in the \fB/etc/neubot/users\fP
configuration file (see the \fI\%FILES\fP section).
.sp
The command line interface allows you to get the usage string
(\fBneubot \-\-help\fP), get the version number (\fBneubot \-V\fP), and
run a Neubot\(aqs subcommand (\fBneubot subcommand...\fP).
.SH IMPLEMENTED TESTS
.sp
All Neubot tests receive and send random data. Neubot does
not monitor the user\(aqs traffic.
.sp
Neubot implements three active network tests: \fBbittorrent\fP, \fBraw\fP and
\fBspeedtest\fP. For each test, there is a Neubot subcommand that allows
to run the test immediately. Moreover, Neubot schedules one of the
three tests at random every 23 \- 27 minutes.
.sp
The \fBbittorrent\fP test emulates BitTorrent peer\-wire protocol and
estimates the round\-trip time, the download and the upload goodput
(i.e. the application\-level speed measured at the receiver).
It uses the time that connect() takes to complete as an estimator of
the round\-trip time. It estimates the goodput by dividing the amount of
transferred bytes by the elapsed time. To avoid consuming too much
user resources, the \fBbittorrent\fP test adapts the number of bytes to
transfer such that the test runs for about five seconds.
.sp
The \fBraw\fP test performs a \fIraw\fP 10\-second TCP download to estimate
the download goodput. Also, it estimates the goodput from the
round\-trip time, and it collects statistics about the TCP sender
by using Web100 (see \fBhttp://www.web100.org\fP). In addition, it
estimates the round\-trip time in two ways: (1) by measuring the
time that connect() takes to complete (like \fBbittorrent\fP) and (2)
by measuring the average time elapsed between sending a small request
and receiving a small response.
.sp
The \fBspeedtest\fP test emulates HTTP and estimates the round\-trip
time, the download and the upload goodput. It estimates the round\-trip
time in two ways: (1) by measuring the time that connect() takes
to complete (like \fBbittorrent\fP) and (2) by measuring the average
time elapsed between sending a small request and receiving a small
response (like \fBraw\fP). It estimates the goodput by dividing the
amount of transferred bytes by the elapsed time. To avoid consuming
too much user resources, the \fBbittorrent\fP test adapts the number
of bytes to transfer such that the test runs for about five seconds.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.sp
This section documents Neubot\(aqs subcommands.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBneubot bittorrent [\-6fv] [\-A address] [\-p port]\fP
Asks Neubot to run a bittorrent test using the web API and fails
if Neubot is not running in the background.
.sp
Accepts the following options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-6
Prefer IPv6 to IPv4.
.TP
.BI \-A \ address
Address of the remote test server.
.TP
.B \-f
Force the test. Run the test in the local process context
(instead of using the web API) and override privacy
settings if needed. Useful for developers and for debugging.
.TP
.BI \-p \ port
Port of the remote test server.
.TP
.B \-v
Makes the command more verbose.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBneubot database [\-f database] [action]\fP
Performs the specified \fBaction\fP or prints the database\(aqs path
if no action is specified.  We do not recommended to use this
command to modify the database while Neubot is running, since
Neubot does not expect the database to change while it is
running, so it won\(aqt pick the changes up. This command requires
\fBroot\fP privileges to modify the database: if you are not
\fBroot\fP, the database is opened in readonly mode.
.sp
Accepts the following options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.BI \-f \ database
Force file. Forces the command to use \fIdatabase\fP instead of the default
database path.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Implements the following actions:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B delete_all
Deletes all the results in the database.
.TP
.B dump
Dumps to the standard ouput the content of the database in JSON format.
.TP
.B prune
Removes results older than one year.
.TP
.B regen_uuid
Generates a new random unique identifier (or UUID) for Neubot. (See
the \fI\%PRIVACY\fP section for more on the UUID).
.TP
.B show
Pretty prints to the standard ouput the content of the database
in JSON format.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBneubot privacy [\-Pt] [\-D setting=value] [\-f database]\fP
Manage privacy settings. When invoked without
options, this command prints the current privacy
settings values.
.sp
Accepts the following options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-D setting=value
Turn on (nonzero) and off (zero) the specified privacy
setting.
.sp
This command just modifies the database: you have to
restart Neubot to make changes effective. To modify privacy
settings when Neubot is running, we recommend to use the
web interface.
.sp
Privacy settings:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B informed
The user has read the privacy policy.
.TP
.B can_collect
The user provides the permission to collect his/her IP
address for research purposes.
.TP
.B can_publish
The user provides the permission to publish his/her IP
address allowing anyone to reuse it for research purposes.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.BI \-f \ database
Force file. Forces the command to use database instead of the
default database path.
.TP
.B \-P
Prints privacy policy on the standard output.
.TP
.B \-t
Test.  Exits with success (exit value \fI0\fP) if all privacy
settings all nonzero.  Exits with failure (exit value
\fInonzero\fP) if at least one setting is zero.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBneubot raw [\-6fv] [\-A address] [\-p port]\fP
Asks Neubot to run a raw test using the web API and fails if
Neubot is not running in the background.
.sp
Accepts the following options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-6
Prefer IPv6 to IPv4.
.TP
.BI \-A \ address
Address of the remote test server.
.TP
.B \-f
Force the test. Run the test in the local process context
(instead of using the web API) and override privacy
settings if needed. Useful for developers and for debugging.
.TP
.BI \-p \ port
Port of the remote test server.
.TP
.B \-v
Makes the command more verbose.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBneubot speedtest [\-6fv] [\-A address] [\-p port]\fP
Asks Neubot to run a speedtest test using the web API and fails
if Neubot is not running in the background.
.sp
Accepts the following options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-6
Prefer IPv6 to IPv4.
.TP
.BI \-A \ address
Address of the remote test server.
.TP

Force the test. Run the test in the local process context
(instead of using the web API) and override privacy
settings if needed. Useful for developers and for debugging.
.TP
.BI \-p \ port
Port of the remote test server.
.TP
.B \-v
Makes the command more verbose.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBneubot start\fP
On MacOS this command runs launchctl(1), which in turn starts
Neubot. You must be \fBroot\fP to run this command.  On MacOS, Neubot\(aqs
installer configures the system to launch Neubot at startup; i.e.
you do not typically need to run this command.
.sp
(On MacOS, Neubot is implemented by two daemons: the usual unprivileged
daemon and a privileged daemon. The latter controls the former and
periodically forks an unprivileged child to check for updates.)
.sp
On MacOS, the start command accepts the following options:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-a
Auto\-updates. When this flag is specified, the privileged
daemon periodically forks an unprivileged child to check
for updates.
.TP
.B \-d
Debug. When this flag is specified, Neubot runs in
the foreground.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose. When this flag is specified, the start command
is verbose (i.e. it prints on the standard error
the commands it is about to invoke).
.sp
When both \-v and \-d are specified, Neubot runs in verbose mode
in the foreground.
.UNINDENT
.sp
At boot time, launchctl(1) starts Neubot with the \-a and \-d
command line options.
.sp
On other UNIX systems, the start command forks the Neubot daemon,
which drops \fBroot\fP privileges and runs in the background.  On such
systems, this command does not accept any command line option.
.TP
.B \fBneubot status\fP
This command asks the status of Neubot using the web API.  It
returns 0 if connect() succeeds and the response is OK, nonzero
otherwise.
.sp
On MacOS this command accepts the \fB\-v\fP option, which makes it
more verbose. On other UNIX systems, it does not accept any
command line option.
.TP
.B \fBneubot stop\fP
On MacOS, this command runs launchctl(1), which in turn stops
Neubot. You must be \fBroot\fP to run this command. On MacOS, this
command accepts the \fB\-v\fP option, which makes it more verbose.
.sp
On other UNIX systems, this command uses the web
API to request Neubot to exit.
.TP
.B \fBneubot viewer\fP
This command shows the web interface by embedding a web
rendering engine into a window manager\(aqs window. Currently,
the only implemented \fBviewer\fP is based on \fBpython\-webkit\fP
and \fBpygtk\fP.

.TP
.B \fBjs/update.js\fP
Minimal script included by updater.html. It just sets the active
tab in the web interface.
.TP
.B \fBjs/utils.js\fP
Miscellaneous helper functions.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBlang/\fP
Directory that contains one javascript file for each language in which
the web interface is translated. Each of these javascripts contains
a dictionary, named \fBLANG\fP, that maps a string (or a key representing
a string) to its translation.
.sp
In javascript, you mark strings for translation by wrapping them
with \fBi18n.get()\fP calls. For example, to indicate that the string
"Disable automatic tests" should be translated, you should write:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&...
i18n.get("Disable automatic tests");
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In HTML code, you mark the content of an HTML tag for translation by adding
the tag to the \fBi18n\fP class. Differently from javascript, we don\(aqt map
the content of an HTML tag to its translation; instead, we map a key that
represents the HTML tag content to its translation. The key is another HTML
class, which must start with \fBi18n_\fP, as in the following example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&...
<p class="i18n i18n_foobar">Neubot web interface</p>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To translate the two examples above in, for example, Italian you
edit the \fBwww/lang/it.css\fP file and add:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
var LANG = {
    ...
    "Disable automatic tests": "Disabilita test automatici",
    "i18n_foobar": "Interfaccia web di Neubot",

Description of the plots and tables included into \fBresults.html\fP
when test \fBfoo\fP is selected. The format of the JSON is documented
into the \fI\%WEB API\fP section of this manual page.
.TP
.B \fBtest/foo.json.local\fP
When \fBfoo.json.local\fP exists, Neubot will use it (instead of
\fBfoo.json\fP) to prepare plots and tables in \fBresults.html\fP.
Allows the user to heavily customize the results page for test
\fBfoo\fP.

When this API is invoked, Neubot exits immediately (i.e. without
sending any response).
.sp
Don\(aqt use this API to shut down Neubot on MacOS, use the \fBneubot
stop\fP command instead. This API, in fact, has effect on the unprivileged
Neubot process only, and the privileged process will respawn the
unprivileged process once it notices it died.
.TP
.B \fB/api/index\fP

If nonzero, the API formats logs like they are printed on the
system logger (i.e. as a text/plain sequence of lines). Otherwise,
the API returns the JSON list of dictionaries described above.
.TP
.B \fBreversed (int) [default: 0]\fP
If nonzero logs are reversed (i.e. the most recent log record is
the first element of the list). Otherwise logs are returned in
natural order (the most recent log record is the last element of
the list).
.TP
.B \fBverbosity (int) [default: 1]\fP
When the verbosity is less than 1, only \fBERROR\fP and \fBWARNING\fP
messages are returned. When the verbosity is 1, the API returns
also \fBINFO\fP messages. When the verbosity is greater than 1,
the API returns also \fBINFO\fP and \fBDEBUG\fP messages.

While running, Neubot generates a limited set of events, which drive
the web interface. For example, the \fBtest_download\fP event value
is used to update the download speed in the right
sidebar of the web interface.

.SH DATA PROCESSING LANGUAGE
.sp
The data processing language is a simple LISP\-like language. As such,
it describes processes whose goal is to transform pieces of collected data
by using lists.
.sp
Differently from traditional LISP syntax, however, the data processing
language is encoded using JSON.
.sp
The language implements the following operations:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB["divide", atom\-or\-list, atom\-or\-list]\fP
Divides the left atom (or list) by the right atom (or list) and
returns the result.
.TP
.B \fB["map\-select", atom, list]\fP
Cycles over the list and, for each element, it selects the
field indicated by the atom.
.TP
.B \fB["parse\-json", atom\-or\-list]\fP
Parses the value of the atom (or list) into an object.
.TP
.B \fB["reduce\-avg", list]\fP
Computes the average value of the list.
.TP
.B \fB["select", atom, object]\fP
Selects the element of object indicated by atom.
.TP
.B \fB["to\-datetime", atom\-or\-list]\fP
Converts atom (or list) to datetime string.
.TP
.B \fB["to\-millisecond", atom\-or\-list]\fP
Converts atom (or list) to millisecond.
.TP
.B \fB["to\-millisecond\-string", atom\-or\-list]\fP
Converts atom (or list) to millisecond string.
.TP
.B \fB["to\-speed", atom\-or\-list]\fP
Converts atom (or list) to speed (in bits per second).
.TP
.B \fB["to\-speed\-string", atom\-or\-list]\fP
Converts atom (or list) to speed string (in bits per second).
.TP
.B \fB"result"\fP
The current piece of data we are processing.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Example (select the \fBjson_data\fP field of the result, convert it to json,
take the \fBclient\fP field, take and compute the average of the \fBalrtt_list\fP
field, convert the result to millisecond):
.INDENT 0.0

.SH PRIVACY
.sp
Neubot collects your IP address, which is personal data according to
European privacy laws. For this reason, Neubot needs to obtain your
permission to collect your IP address for research purposes, as well
as to publish it on the web for the same purpose. In addition, it
also needs that you assert that you have read the privacy policy.
.sp
Without the assertion that you have read the privacy policy and the
permission to collect and publish your IP address, Neubot can not
perform automatic (or manual) tests.
.sp
You can read Neubot\(aqs privacy policy by running the \fBneubot privacy \-P\fP
command. The privacy policy is also available at:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
http://127.0.0.1:9774/privacy.html
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Of course, if you modified the address and/or port where Neubot listens,
you need to update the URI accordingly.
.sp
In addition to the above, each Neubot is identified by a random
unique identifier (UUID) that is used to perform time series
analysis. We believe that this identifier does not brach your
privacy: in the worst case, we would be able to say that a given
Neubot has changed Internet address (anche, hence, ISP and/or
location). To regenerate your unique identifier, you can run
the \fBneubot database regen_uuid\fP command.
