         Neubot is DISABLED: starting from version 0.4.6, Neubot servers
         are deployed on the distributed
         <a href="http://www.measurementlab.net/">Measurement Lab</a>
         server platform.  To comply with Measurement Lab policy and be allowed
         to run tests, Neubot needs to ask you the permission to collect and
         publish your
         Internet address.  You can provide both permissions below, but read
         Neubot full privacy policy first.

The Neubot project is a research effort that aims to study the quality
and neutrality of ordinary users' Internet connections, to rebalance the
information asymmetry between them and Service Providers.  The Neubot
software (i) *measures* the quality and neutrality of your Internet
connection.  The raw measurement results are (ii) *collected* on the
measurement servers for research purposes and (iii) *published*, to allow
other individuals and institutions to reuse them for research purposes.

To *measure* the quality and neutrality of your Internet connection,
the Neubot software does not monitor or analyze your Internet traffic.
It just uses a fraction of your connection capacity to perform background
transmission tests, sending and/or receiving random data.  The results
contain the measured performance metrics, such as the download speed,
or the latency, as well as your computer load, as a percentage, and
*your Internet address*.

The Internet address is paramount because it allows to *infer your Internet
Service Provider* and to have a rough idea of *your location*, allowing to
put the results in context.  The Neubot project needs to *collect* it
to study the data and wants to *publish* it to enable other individuals
and institutions to carry alternative studies and/or peer-review its
measurements and data analysis methodology.  This is coherent with the
policy of the distributed server platform that empowers the Neubot
project, Measurement Lab (M-Lab), which requires all results to be
released as open data [1]_.

You are reading this privacy policy because Neubot is developed in the
European Union, where there is consensus that Internet addresses are
*personal data*.  This means that the Neubot project cannot store, process
or publish your address without your prior *informed consent*, under the
provisions of the "Codice in materia di protezione dei dati personali"
(Decree 196/03) [2]_.  In accordance with the law, data controller is the
NEXA Center for Internet &amp; Society [3]_, represented by its co-director Juan
Carlos De Martin.

Via its web interface [4]_, the Neubot software asks you (a) to explicitly
assert that you are *informed*, i.e. that you have read the privacy
policy, (b) to give it the permission to *collect* and (c) *publish* your
IP address.  If you don't assert (a) and you don't give the permission
to do (b) and (c), Neubot cannot run tests because, if it did, it would
violate privacy laws and/or Measurement Lab policy.

The data controller guarantees you the rights as per Art. 7 of the
above-mentioned Decree 196/03.  Basically, you have total control over
you personal data, and you can, for example, inquire Neubot to remove
your Internet address from its data sets.  To exercise your rights, please
write to &lt;privacy@neubot.org&gt; or to "NEXA Center for Internet &amp; Society,
Dipartimento di Automatica e Infomatica, Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca
degli Abruzzi 24, 10129 Turin, ITALY."
