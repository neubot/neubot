"""
  This module contains class methods to switch from version number's
  *canonical* representation to *numeric* representation and viceversa.
  It also contains a method to compare two version numbers in canonical
  representation.

  A version number in canonical representation is a string and follows the
  standard numbering schema MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.RCNUM.  MAJOR must
  be a positive integer, while MINOR, PATCH and RCNUM must be between 0
  and 999.  This is to allow for numeric representation.

  A version number in numeric representation is the string representation
  of a float.  It must have nine digits after the radix point. For example,
  `0.037001003` is the numeric representation of `0.37.1.3`.

  The general idea is that of using the canonical representation to label
  new versions to avoid user confusion.  We will use the numeric representation
  internally, for example in the results database.  The advantage, in this
  case, is that the version number can be treated as a float by statistical
  packages.  So it is possible to write rules and conditions based on the
  version number in a simple way.
