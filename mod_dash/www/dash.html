    <p>The dash test emulates the DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over
       HTTP) protocol, which is defined in the DASH ISO/IEC 23009-1
       standard.
       As for the raw test, this test selects a random Measurement Lab server
       each time (so the download speed is expected to oscillate with the
       round-trip latency).
       The protocol emulated by this test downloads multiple HTTP resources
       from the same server, thus multiple download speed measurements are
       produced for each single test.</p>

    <p>We plan to use this test's results to study the network behaviour in
       case of multimedia streaming and to better understand rate adaptation
       algorithms that aim at always reproducing media at the maximum achievable
       quality supported by the network.</p>
